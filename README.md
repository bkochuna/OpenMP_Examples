# OpenMP_Examples
Repository with instructive OpenMP examples. These examples are here for use within NERS-590 Methods and Practice of Scientific Computing.

These examples are derived from those developed by Tim Mattson for the [ATPESC Workshop](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/sessions/presentation-the-openmp-common-core-a-hands-on-exploration/). Tim's original examples may be found [here](https://github.com/tgmattso/ATPESC.git). And also from John Urbanic from a 2014 HPC workshop at the Pittsburgh Computing Center.


Presently, the following examples are included
- hello world
- Numerical integration of pi using the midpoint rule
- Finite difference of heat equation for Simulated Annealing

Examples are provided in both Fortran and C/C++.
